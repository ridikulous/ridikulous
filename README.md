- ðŸ‘‹ Hi, Iâ€™m @ridikulous or Nikolas Rowland
- Most of my stuff is on my [Replit Account](https://replit.com/@NikolasRowland)
- ðŸ‘€ Iâ€™m interested in Web Dev, python, and node.js.
- ðŸŒ± Iâ€™m currently learning random js and react frameworks and python libraries
- ðŸ“« You can always share a project with me on replit, email me [here](mailto:nikolaskrowland@gmail.com), or contact me on github (I rarely check my Github though)
- ðŸ˜„ Pronouns: (This is such a stupid field I am not going to fill it out in protest)
- âš¡ Fun fact: I'm just some 12 year old coder. I may lack simple weather reports but got bad*ss code. :)
- I do stuff for [Chatterbox](https://chbx.us) which me and @jayan12k run
